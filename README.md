3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries? 
5. What are the most optimal skillsÂ toÂ learn?
# Tools I Used
For a deep dive into the data analyst job market, several key tools were used which are:

- **SQL :** The backbone of the analysis; enabling the querying of the database to uncover critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL :** The chosen Database management system for this project, ideal for data storage and retrieval.
- **Visual Studio Code :** My go-to preferred tool for database management, viewing tables, running migrations and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub :** Essential for version control that helps track changes in source code and ensuring collaboration among teams.
# The Analysis
Each query for this project focused on exploring specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I tackled each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Roles
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs
in 2023:
- **Job Title Variety :** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

- **Wide Salary Range :** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
